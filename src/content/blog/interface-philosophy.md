# The Membrane Between Worlds

An interface is more than a technical construct - it is a philosophical statement about how we choose to divide complexity.

## Contracts and Trust

When we define an interface, we establish a contract not just between modules, but between our present and future selves. We say: "This is what I promise to provide, and this is what I expect in return."

```typescript
interface UserRepository {
  findById(id: string): Promise<User | null>;
  save(user: User): Promise<void>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

This simple interface embodies profound assumptions about persistence, identity, and time.

## The Liskov Substitution Principle as Moral Framework

Barbara Liskov's substitution principle is not merely about inheritance - it's about honesty in abstraction. If we promise one thing and deliver another, we break the fundamental trust that makes modular systems possible.

## Information Hiding as Kindness

When we hide implementation details behind an interface, we perform an act of kindness for future programmers. We say: "You need not concern yourself with these complexities."

## The Paradox of Flexibility

The more flexible we make an interface, the more complex it becomes. The art lies in finding the minimal surface area that accommodates necessary variation without overwhelming the user.

## Evolving Interfaces: The Ship of Theseus

As requirements change, interfaces must evolve. But when does an interface become so different that it's no longer the same interface? This is software's version of the Ship of Theseus paradox.

Version compatibility becomes a question of identity: at what point does evolution become revolution?
