# Layers of Digital Sediment

Every codebase tells a story. Like archaeological layers, each commit, each function, each comment represents a moment in time when a developer made a decision.

## The Artifact Analysis

When encountering a mysterious function, one must approach it with the care of an archaeologist:

1. **Context First**: What surrounds this code? What were the constraints of its era?
2. **Dating the Artifact**: Git blame becomes our carbon dating
3. **Cultural Significance**: Understanding the programming paradigms of the time

```typescript
// Found in a dusty corner of the codebase
// Circa 2018, jQuery era
function mysteriousDataProcessor(data: any[]): any {
    return data.filter(x => x.status !== 'deleted')
               .map(x => ({ ...x, processed: true }))
               .sort((a, b) => a.created - b.created);
}
```

## The Rosetta Stone Principle

Good documentation is the Rosetta Stone of software. It allows future developers to decode the intentions of their predecessors.

Without it, we're left to piece together meaning from fragments - variable names, function signatures, and the occasional illuminating comment.

## Preservation Ethics

As digital archaeologists, we have a responsibility to preserve knowledge while modernizing systems. Every refactoring is both preservation and transformation.
